# Step-by-Step Process:

## Step 1: Data Preparation
### Objective: Ensure data is clean and ready for analysis.
### Actions: Reviewed data for missing or inconsistent entries. Adjusted formats as needed for easier pivot table creation.
### Tools Used: Data validation and basic formatting in Excel.

## Step 2: Creating Pivot Table

### Actions:
### Inserted a pivot table from the sales data.
### Rows: Added Brand and Region fields to display sales by brand and region.
### Columns: Added Month to analyze monthly trends.
### Values: Aggregated QTY (quantity) and AMT (sales amount).
### Result: A dynamic table summarizing total sales and quantity sold per brand, per region, over time.

## Step 3: Inserting Slicers
### Objective: Make the pivot table more interactive by enabling dynamic filtering.
### Actions:
### Inserted slicers for Brand, Region, and Month.
### Connected slicers to the pivot table for filtering.
### Result: The user can easily filter data and view specific sales details by selecting options in the slicers.

## Step 4: Creating Pivot Chart
### Objective: Visualize sales trends in an easy-to-understand format.
#### Actions:
### Created a pivot chart from the pivot table.
### Selected a suitable chart type (e.g., line chart for sales trends, bar chart for brand comparison).
### Added data labels and customized the chart (color coding by brand, adding titles).
### Result: A visually appealing chart that updates dynamically as slicers are used to filter data.
