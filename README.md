# Sales Performance Analysis using Pivot Tables & Charts

## Project Overview
This project is an analysis of sales data using Excel. The main objective is to create a dynamic sales report using pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers to provide insights into brand performance across different regions and months.

### Key Objectives:
- **Summarize sales** by brand, region, and time period using pivot tables.
- **Create slicers** to dynamically filter the data by brand, region, and month.
- **Visualize sales trends** using pivot charts.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each sales transaction.
- **Brand**: The brand of the product sold (e.g., Nike, Adidas).
- **Region**: Geographical region of the sale.
- **State & City**: Location details of the sale.
- **Quantity (QTY)**: Number of products sold.
- **Amount (AMT)**: Total sales amount (in INR).

## Steps in the Analysis
### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation:
- Ensured that the data was clean and consistent, with no missing or erroneous entries.

### 2. Pivot Table Creation:
- Created pivot tables to summarize total sales by `Brand`, `Region`, and `Month`.
- Rows: `Brand`, `Region`
- Columns: `Month`
- Values: Aggregated `QTY` (quantity) and `AMT` (sales amount).

### 3. Slicer Insertion:
- Added slicers for `Brand`, `Region`, and `Month` to allow for easy filtering of the pivot table and chart.

### 4. Pivot Chart Creation:
- Created a pivot chart from the pivot table to visualize the sales trends.
- Chart Type: Bar chart (or line chart) to compare sales performance across regions and months.

## Key Insights
- **Top Brands**: Nike recorded the highest sales across all regions, particularly in the East region.
- **Regional Sales Trends**: Sales were highest in the East region, with significant growth observed in April.
- **Monthly Trends**: April saw an overall increase in sales for all brands.

## Visuals
