# 1. Project Overview:
## Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis using Pivot Tables & Charts.
## Objective: Analyze sales data to provide insights on performance by brand, region, and month. The project involves creating pivot tables and charts for easy visualization, with slicers for dynamic filtering.
## Data Source: A dataset of sales transactions containing fields such as Order ID, Brand, Region, State, City, Quantity, and Amount.
## Key Deliverables:
Pivot table summarizing sales data.
Pivot chart to visualize trends.
Slicers to filter data by region, month, and brand.
# 2. Dataset Overview:
## Data Fields:
Order ID: Unique identifier for each sales transaction.
Brand: The brand of the product sold (e.g., Nike, Adidas).
Month: Month of the transaction.
Region: Geographical region of the sale.
State, City: Location details of the sale.
QTY: Quantity of products sold.
AMT: Sales amount in INR.
# 3. Step-by-Step Process:
## Step 1: Data Preparation
Objective: Ensure data is clean and ready for analysis.
Actions: Reviewed data for missing or inconsistent entries. Adjusted formats as needed for easier pivot table creation.
Tools Used: Data validation, text-to-columns (if any data was unstructured), and basic formatting in Excel.
## Step 2: Creating Pivot Table
Objective: Summarize sales data by brand, region, and time period.
Actions:
Inserted a pivot table from the sales data.
Rows: Added Brand and Region fields to display sales by brand and region.
Columns: Added Month to analyze monthly trends.
Values: Aggregated QTY (quantity) and AMT (sales amount).
Result: A dynamic table summarizing total sales and quantity sold per brand, per region, over time.
## Step 3: Inserting Slicers
Objective: Make the pivot table more interactive by enabling dynamic filtering.
Actions:
Inserted slicers for Brand, Region, and Month.
Connected slicers to the pivot table for filtering.
Result: The user can easily filter data and view specific sales details by selecting options in the slicers.
## Step 4: Creating Pivot Chart
Objective: Visualize sales trends in an easy-to-understand format.
Actions:
Created a pivot chart from the pivot table.
Selected a suitable chart type (e.g., line chart for sales trends, bar chart for brand comparison).
Added data labels and customized the chart (color coding by brand, adding titles).
Result: A visually appealing chart that updates dynamically as slicers are used to filter data.
